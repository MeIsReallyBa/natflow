# natflow

A fast forwarding stanalone kernel module with zero-patch to kernel. It could be a lite replacement of kmod-ipt-offload.

## Notes
1. ralink driver hwnat compats with natflow but not works for openwrt
2. mtk dsa driver hwnat compats with natflow (need patch https://github.com/x-wrt/x-wrt/blob/master/target/linux/ramips/patches-5.4/990-mtk-driver-hwnat-compat-with-natflow.patch)
